/**
 * FIRESTORE SECURITY RULES
 * 
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model using path-based authorization. 
 * By nesting all data under the /users/{userId} hierarchy, the system ensures 
 * that authorization is performant and scales without the need for additional 
 * cross-document lookups (get() calls).
 * 
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}/audits/{auditId}: Primary collection for user-owned audits.
 * - /users/{userId}/audits/{auditId}/keyMetrics/{keyMetricId}: Subcollection 
 *   containing granular metrics associated with a specific audit.
 * 
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Ownership is determined by the {userId} wildcard in the document path.
 * - All write operations (create, update, delete) require a verified auth UID 
 *   matching the path.
 * - Relational integrity is enforced by validating that internal document IDs 
 *   (e.g., auditId) match their location in the path during creation and 
 *   remain immutable during updates.
 * - This configuration is optimized for Prototyping Mode: strict on access 
 *   rights but flexible on data types and non-relational fields.
